# streambim-widget-api
A JavaScript library for interacting with StreamBIM from within an embedded widget, as well as for using StreamBIM in embedded mode.

## Integration

StreamBIM widgets have to be whitelisted and then enabled per StreamBIM project. Please contact support@rendra.io if you want to set up a custom widget for one or more projects. 

## Authentication

If your widget requires authentication you have two options:
1. Handle the authentication in the widget itself
2. Use OpenID Connect and provide us with your identity server etc. StreamBIM will then open your login screen in a popup and persist the token per user across sessions.

## Installation

### Using npm

`npm install streambim-widget-api --save`

And import the library into your code. 

To run a widget inside StreamBIM, call something like this from your widget:

```javascript
import StreamBIM from 'streambim-widget-api';

const methods = {
  pickedObject: function (result) {
    console.log('Clicked at ' + result.guid);
  }
}

StreamBIM.connect(methods).then(function() {
  console.log('Connected!');
});
```

To run StreamBIM in embedded mode, first create an iframe, open a StreamBIM project with embedded=true in the URL parameters, and then call the `connectToChild` method.

```javascript
import StreamBIM from 'streambim-widget-api';

const iframe = document.getElementById('streambim_target');
const projectId = PROJECT_ID;

iframe.src = 'https://app.streambim.com/webapp/default/#/viewer?projectId=' + projectId + '&embedded=true';

const methods = {
  pickedObject: function (result) {
    console.log('Clicked at ' + result.guid);
  }
}

StreamBIM.connectToChild(iframe, methods).then(function() {
  console.log('Connected!');
});
```

For full list of supported methods, see Usage below.

### CDN

We don't currently have a CDN solution, but you can download, bundle and load the [minified script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/streambim/streambim-widget-api/master/dist/streambim-widget-api.min.js), in which case the
library will be available on `window.StreamBIM`

```html
<script src="streambim-widget-api.min.js"></script>
<script>
  window.StreamBIM.connect().then(function() {
    console.log('Connected!');
  });
</script>
```
## Usage

```javascript
// From within a widget

StreamBIM.connect({
  pickedObject: function (result) {
    console.log('Clicked at ' + result.guid);
  },
  spacesChanged: function (guids) {
    console.log('Entered space: ' + guids[0]);
  }
}).then( function () {
  console.log('Widget ready');

  StreamBIM.getCameraState().then( (result) => {
    console.log('Got camera state: ', result);
  });
});


// From a parent running StreamBIM in embedded mode
StreamBIM.connectToChild(iframe, {
  pickedObject: function (result) {
    console.log('Clicked at ' + result.guid);
  },
  spacesChanged: function (guids) {
    console.log('Entered space: ' + guids[0]);
  }
}).then( function () {
  console.log('Widget ready');

  StreamBIM.getCameraState().then( (result) => {
    console.log('Got camera state: ', result);
  });
});
```

## API

The API is promise based, which means all functions below return promises. 

### `connect(callbacks)`

This establishes the connection from the widget to StreamBIM. The function returns a promise which has to be fulfilled before any other API calls can be made. 

### `connectToChild(iframe, callbacks)`

This establishes the connection from the parent to StreamBIM in embedded mode. The function returns a promise which has to be fulfilled before any other API calls can be made. 

##### Callbacks

* `pickedObject` (function, optional) Function to be called whenever the user picks an object in StreamBIM. The function has one argument, which is an object containing `point` - the picked 3D coordinate and `guid` - the GUID of the picked object.

* `spacesChanged` (function, optional) Function to be called whenever the user enteres or leaves a space. The function has one argument which is an array of IFC space GUIDs, sorted from the smallest to the largest space. 

* `cameraChanged` (function, optional) Function to be called whenever the user moves or rotates the camera. The function has one argument which holds the camera position (vector) and orientation (quaternion). This complies to the IFC/BCF coordinate system where position (0,0,0) is the model origin and orientation (0,0,0,0) is north. 

* `didExpand` (function, optional) Function to be called whenever the widget is expanded into fullscreen mode, either using the widget API or by the user clicking the expand/contract button in the panel header. 

* `didContract` (function, optional) Function to be called whenever the widget is contracted into side panel mode, either using the widget API or by the user clicking the expand/contract button in the panel header. 


### `getProjectId()`
Returns a promise which is resolved with the project's ID.

### `getUserEmail()`
Returns a promise which is resolved with the authenticated user's email. 

### `getCameraState()`
Returns a promise which is resolved with an object containing the camera's position and quaternion. 

### `setCameraState(state)`
Takes an object of the form 
```javascript
{
  position: [x, y, z],
  quaternion: [x, y, z, w]
}
```
and applies it to the user's camera. 

### `setCameraPosition([x, y, z])`
Moves the camera to position (x, y, z) without modifying the camera's rotation. 

### `getSpaces()`
Returns a promise which is resolved with an array of GUIDs of the spaces the user's camera is currently inside. The spaces are sorted form the smallers to the largest.

### `getObjectInfo(guid)`
Returns a promise which is resolved with an object with various information about the object. 

### `gotoSpace(guid)`
Move the camera to the center of the space.

### `highlightObject(guid)`

### `deHighlightObject(guid)`

### `deHighlightAllObjects()`

### `hideObject(guid)`

### `showObject(guid)`

### `findObjects(query)`
Returns a promise which is resolved with an an array of GUIDs for objects matching the query. 

##### Query options

* `filter.key` The key for the property to search for
* `filter.value` The value of the property to search for
* `page.limit` and `page.skip` for pagination
* `sort.field` and `sort.descending` for sorting (only applies to `getObjectInfoForSearch`)
* `fieldUnion` used for getObjectInfoForSearch only. If true, it returns all properies for all objects. If false, it returns only basic properties. 

```javascript
{
  filter: {
    key: "Type Object Global Id",
    value: "1a7mCik3D1IgMeWf2ZMmvT"
  },
  page: {
    limit: 10,
    skip: 0
  },
  sort: {
    field: 'ID',
    descending: false

  }
}
```

The following example demonstrates how to search for objects, apply the results to the 3D scene, and set the visualization mode:

Tip: Use browser developer tools to inspect network requests after performing a search in StreamBIM. Find the "ifc-searches" request, and examine the request payload for search parameters.

```javascript
// Define search rules and create query object for search
let querySearch = {
    filter: {
        rules: [[{
            psetName: "BIP",
            propKey: "TypeID",
            propType: "str",
            propValue: "123456",
            buildingId: "1000"
        }]]
    },
    page: { limit: 10, skip: 0 },
    sort: { field: 'BIP.TypeID', descending: false }
};

// Perform search and apply results
StreamBIM.findObjects(querySearch).then(function(response) {
    console.log("getObjectInfoForSearch", response);
    let query = { rules: querySearch.filter.rules };

    StreamBIM.applyObjectSearch(query).then( (result) => {
        StreamBIM.setSearchVisualizationMode('PERMANENT');
    }).catch( function(error) {
        console.log("Error applying object search", error);
    });
});
```

### `getObjectInfoForSearch(query)`
Filter the 3D scene to show only objects matching the filter. See `findObjects(query)` for filter options.

### `applyObjectSearch(filter)`
Filter the 3D scene to show only objects matching the filter. See `findObjects(query)` for filter options.

### `resetObjectSearch()`

### `showAllObjects()`

### `showGrids()`

### `hideGrids()`

### `getLayers()`
Returns a list of layers with their visibility status in this form
```javascript
{
  layername_1: true,
  layername_2: true,
  layername_3: false,
  ...
}
```

### `setLayers(layers)`
Sets the visibility of the layers. Takes an object of the form
```javascript
{
  layername_1: true,
  layername_2: true,
  layername_3: false,
  ...
}
```

### `getViewportState()`
Returns a promise which is resolved with an object containing the entire viewport state, including camera position and rotation, hidden- and highlighted objects, hidden layers and clipping planes. 

### `setViewportState(state)`
Resets the viewport and applies the state, which should be on the same form as returned from `getViewportState()`: 
```javascript
{
  cameraState: {
    position: [x, y, z],
    quaternion: [x, y, z, w]
  },
  hiddenObjects: [guid],
  highlightedObjects: [guid],
  hiddenLayers: [layerName],
  clippingPlanes: [{}]
}
```

### `takeScreenshot()`

Returns a promise which is resolved with a dataUrl of the 3D screenshot.

### `setShowExpandButton(bool)`

Show or hide the expand/contract button in the widget panel's header.

### `setExpanded(bool)`

Set to TRUE to expand the widget into fullscreen mode or FALSE to contract the widget into side panel mode.

## Errors
All API calls return promises which, if an error occurs, are rejected with an object which has a `code` and a `detail` field. Code is one of the following: `invalid`, `notFound`, `unknown`, `unauthorized` and `notAllowed`. Detail can contain anything and should only be used for debugging purposes. 

## Demo
Please take a look at the [demo](/demo/index.html) widget for a complete widget implementation example. To see an example of how to run StreamBIM in embedded mode, see the [embedded demo](/demo_embedded/index.html). Notice the CSS rules to ensure that the content is scrollable on touch devices.
